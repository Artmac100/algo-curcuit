# Algo Circuit

An interactive algorithm visualization platform built with Next.js to help understand and learn common algorithms and data structures through visual representation.


## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations** - See algorithms in action with step-by-step animations
- **Multiple Algorithms** - Explore various algorithms and data structures:
  - Search algorithms (Binary Search, Binary Search in Rotated Array)
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort)
  - Data structures (Binary Tree, Stack)
- **Educational Focus** - Each algorithm comes with descriptions and complexity analysis
- **Mobile Responsive** - Works on devices of all sizes

## 🧠 Algorithm Visualizations

The platform currently includes the following algorithms and data structures:

- **Binary Search** - An efficient search algorithm with O(log n) complexity
- **Binary Search in Rotated Array** - A variation of binary search for sorted but rotated arrays
- **Bubble Sort** - A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm
- **Insertion Sort** - A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time
- **Merge Sort** - An efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm
- **Binary Tree** - A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children
- **Stack** - A linear data structure following the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle
